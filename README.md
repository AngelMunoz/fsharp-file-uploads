# File Upload Sample

This is a small sample that shows how to upload a file from an HTML Form to an F# backend.

The backends here are

- [Falco](https://www.falcoframework.com/)
- [Saturn](https://saturnframework.org/)

While they're mainly the same as they both are built on top of ASP.NET it is nice to have a focused sample that works as a reference in case you need it.

I'll write a post about this, once it is up I'll link to it.
